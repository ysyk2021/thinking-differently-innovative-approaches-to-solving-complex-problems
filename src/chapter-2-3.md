The creative process is a non-linear, iterative process that involves generating ideas, refining them, and ultimately developing a solution. Here are the key stages of the creative process:

1. Preparation: Gathering information and resources related to the problem.

2. Incubation: Allowing time for the unconscious mind to process the problem and generate new ideas.

3. Illumination: The sudden insight or "aha!" moment when an idea comes to mind.

4. Verification: Testing and refining the idea to develop a workable solution.
